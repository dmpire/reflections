What happens when you initialize a repository?
 Why do you need to do it?

MY REFLECTIONS : 

Initializing a repository adds a .git folder to 
the repository which then makes it easy for git
commands to be used in manipulating the 
repository. 

------------------------------------------------- 

How is the staging area different from the working
directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

MY REFLECTIONS : 

The staging area is like a linking bridge between 
the repository and the working directory. Stuff is
brought from the working directory and kept on this
bridge so that eventually the stuff on this bridge 
can be taken to the repository. Using git reset, this 
stuff can be recalled from the bridge and sent back
to the working directory. (I'm using a seller buyer
market analogy here. but you get it.)

As to value, I'm not entirely sure at the moment
what value it offers but when i decide, i'll remember
to come back and update this.

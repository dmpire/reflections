These are a collection of my reflections based on the Udacity git and github course. 
It is believed that such reflections help in deep learning because you're not just 
accumulating knowledge, but you are taking time to think about the knowledge you have 
acquired and are acquiring as time goes on.
These reflections each cover a different section of the course, from version control
to git to github.
Enjoy.

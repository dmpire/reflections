How did viewing a diff between two versions of 
a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

MY REFLECTIONS : 

Viewing the difference between two versions of a 
file so as to see the bug that was introduced
was amazing for me , especially because i didn't
 even know that that was a possibility. I used 
to just pore over my codes for hours , sometimes
 i literally would feel depressed but using FC 
(Yep, cause i use Windows), it's sooooooo easy! 
I totally love it already.

How could having easy access to the entire history of 
a file make you a more efficient programmer 
in the long term?

MY REFLECTIONS : 

-------------------------------------------------
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually 
choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, 
like Google Docs does?

MY REFLECTIONS :

PROS
1. The history log can be controlled so we don't have
unnecessary files logging.

CONS
1. If you stay in a place with unreliable power supply, 
your computer could shutdown before you get a chance to 
commit your work and so you lose your progress.

-------------------------------------------------
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, 
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

MY REFLECTIONS:
So that each commit has a logical change/ difference.
If any commit has a bug, it's easier getting to it.

-------------------------------------------------
How can you use the commands git log and git diff 
to view the history of files?

MY REFLECTIONS:
git log usually gives you a list of all the changes 
that have been made to a page while you can use the 
commit ID of the most recent commit to the doc and 
compare it to the one that has the change you're
 interested in using the git diff command.

--------------------------------------------------
How might using version control make you more confident
 to make changes that could break something?

MY REFLECTIONS:
Using version control makes me more confident about 
making errors because i know i can easily find out 
and correct the mistakes i make.

--------------------------------------------------
Now that you have your workspace set up,
what do you want to try using Git for?

MY REFLECTIONS:
i will participate in the 100 Days of Code Challenge.

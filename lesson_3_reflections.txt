When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

MY REFLECTIONS:
When working with other people so like the other person pushes certain changes to 
the repository and when working from a different computer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 MY REFLECTIONS:

 So that git doesn't have to be over-worked unnecessarily?
 i'm not entirely sure because automation always seems like such a good idea.

 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
 When would you use one instead of another?

 MY REFLECTIONS:

Fork basically clones or copies someone else's repository on GitHub to your own
GitHub account and maintains a link so people know who was the original owner of
the project which is a way of giving credit to the person. Fork also makes it 
possible/ easier for you to later contribute to a repository.

Clone means to copy a repository from GitHub to your Local Computer.

Branches is basically like creating different compartments or components or features
of the same project.

I feel the above explanations also answer the second question.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

MY REFLECTIONS:
When working with other people so like the other person pushes certain changes to 
the repository and when working from a different computer.

-------------------------------------------------

Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
 with your remote repository?

 MY REFLECTIONS:

 So that git doesn't have to be over-worked unnecessarily?
 i'm not entirely sure because automation always seems like 
 such a good idea.
